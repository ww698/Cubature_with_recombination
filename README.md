# Cubature_with_recombination
A demonstration of creating cubature formula using recombination

Aim: To reduce a cubature formula in arbitrary dimension d to get a degree n cubature formula. Here we have created formulae for calculating moments of multivariate normal (Gauss-Hermite cubature) and multivariate uniform (Gauss-Legendre cubature) distributions. We have also created a function to reduce arbitrary cubature rules to create more efficient formulae via recombination.
